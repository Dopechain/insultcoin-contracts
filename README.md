# InsultCoin

~~InsultCoin is a high-tech state-of-the-art blockchain platform for seamlessly and securely managing insults.~~

## Sorry for overhyping

Sorry for overhyping. InsultCoin is a project that lets you send and receive insults to anybody
on the blockchain. Currently only available on BSC, but when I get the money, it will come to Ethereum,
a bunch of random layer-2s, probably Polygon, HECO? It'll go cross-chain one day, ok?

## Mission Statement

We want to allow all people from around the world with an Internet connection to be able to
insult each other in an uncensored and secure way, making location irrelevant to insulting.

## Disclaimer

This is basically a homebrew token project with spaghetti code slathered around.  
No audits, no secure-lock-insurance-whatever, cuz I'm not able to afford it with my budget.

## Tokenomics

75% of the total supply goes towards the ICO, while 25% stays with me.
I swear, I wanted to do 1% but my mom wanted to cash in on this idea,
so I relented. This money is vested over 3 years.

## Governance

I don't want InsultCoin to become a security, and my budget doesn't allow me to
consult a lawyer, and I have to account for the laws of a bunch of regions
around the world, so no it will not have a built-in governance system.
However, there is by default a timelock controller from OpenZeppelin that
forces me to wait a couple hours before making changes.

In the InsultCoin code, there are multiple roles:

- Owner: Administrator of all roles, bound by the timelock if enabled.
- Funds Manager: Controls all contracts' funds and some aspects of tokenomics.
- Minters: Can mint tokens at any time, and as much as they wish.
- Moderators: Can freeze accounts and the entire InsultCoin network.

## "Roadmap"

To be honest, I think I'm going to be giving up on a couple of these,
so don't consider them promises.

### Stage 1: Idiots & Insults [x]

- Deploy the insulting, token, ICO and other basic contracts to BSC

### Stage 2 []

- Improve upon the tokenomics
- An InsultCoin lottery
- ~~Market manipulation to pump the price~~

### Stage 3 []

- Bridge INSULT across different chains
- Create a native Insult Chain for high-speed insulting
